It is designed to simplify the process of building applications that rely on a database for data persistence and management.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis framework offers a streamlined approach to developing applications with database backends. It leverages Knex.js for database interactions, providing a robust and flexible query builder. The framework also integrates features for permission management and real-time updates, making it suitable for a wide range of application types.\n\n## Key Features\n\n-   **Database Management**: Uses Knex.js to interact with databases, offering an intuitive API for querying, creating, updating, and deleting data.\n-   **Permission Management**: Includes a sophisticated system for managing permissions, allowing you to control data access at a granular level.\n-   **Real-Time Support**: Capable of handling real-time updates, enabling applications to respond dynamically to data changes.\n-   **Hooks**: Provides a mechanism for implementing hooks, allowing you to intercept and modify database operations.\n\n## Core Components\n\nThis directory contains the following essential parts of the framework:\n\n-   **Database**: The core database integration logic, including schema management and data manipulation.\n-   **Permission Management**: The system responsible for handling permissions and access control.\n-   **Hooks**: The mechanism for intercepting and modifying database operations.\n-   **Types**: All type definitions used within the framework.\n- **Adapters**: logic for different adapter implementations, like express, or other type of servers\n-   **Schema**: the files needed for modify the schema.\n-   **index**: the main file, that exports and expose all the framework capabilities\n\n## Usage\n\nThis framework is designed to be integrated into a larger application. The components within this directory are the building blocks for creating database-backed applications with advanced features.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to the framework are welcome. Please refer to the main project's contributing guidelines for more information.\n"))
